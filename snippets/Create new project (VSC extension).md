Scaffolds a basic Quarkus starter project with the Quarkus extension for Visual Studio Code.

First, install the [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io) extension for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (or [VS Codium](https://vscodium.com/) if you're more into Open Source).

You do this by:
1. clicking on the extension button on the left, 
2. searching for the termn "Quarkus" and then 
3. selecting the *Install* button either in the list pane or the detail window.

After installation (no restart required), go to the *Quarkus Welcome* page (which can manually be opened with *F1*->*Quarkus Welcome*) and click the button *Create Quarkus project*.

Alternatively, enter *F1*->*Generate a Quarkus project*.

Follow the instructions (build tool selection, group, artifact, version, framework/library selection etc.). Either confirm with *Enter* or skip with *Escape*. Finally, select (and perhaps create) a destination folder for the project source code.



NB - The Quarkus' VS Code extension's repository release page can be found at https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-quarkus/releases.
